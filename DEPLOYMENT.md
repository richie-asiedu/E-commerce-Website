# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your e-commerce website to GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to enable GitHub Pages

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/richie-asiedu/E-commerce-Website`
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "gh-pages" branch
6. Click "Save"

**Important**: If you see "404 - There isn't a GitHub Pages site here", this means GitHub Pages hasn't been enabled yet. Follow the steps above to enable it.

## Step 2: Configure Repository Settings

1. In the same Settings page, go to "Actions" â†’ "General"
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
3. Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
4. Click "Save"

## Step 3: Verify Homepage URL

The homepage URL in `package.json` should match your repository:

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://richie-asiedu.github.io/E-commerce-Website"
}
```

## Step 4: Deploy

### Option A: Manual Deployment

1. Run the build command:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Option B: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. Push your changes to the master branch:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update website"
git push origin master
```

2. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
   - Build the project
   - Deploy to the gh-pages branch
   - Make your website live

## Step 5: Verify Deployment

1. Wait 2-5 minutes for the deployment to complete
2. Check the "Actions" tab in your repository to see if the workflow completed successfully
3. Visit your website at: `https://richie-asiedu.github.io/E-commerce-Website`
4. Check that all features are working correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **404 Error**: 
   - Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
   - Verify the source is set to "gh-pages" branch
   - Check that the workflow completed successfully in the Actions tab

2. **Images not loading**: 
   - Make sure the base path in `vite.config.ts` matches your repository name
   - Verify that the `base` path is correctly set to `/E-commerce-Website/`

3. **Build fails**: 
   - Check the GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages
   - Verify all dependencies are properly installed

### Manual Fixes

If automatic deployment fails:

1. Check the Actions tab in your repository
2. Review the build logs for errors
3. Fix any issues and push again
4. The workflow will automatically retry

## Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:

1. Add a `CNAME` file to the `public` folder with your domain
2. Configure your domain's DNS settings
3. Update the homepage URL in `package.json`
4. Deploy again

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify your repository settings
3. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
